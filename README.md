# Portfolio

This is a temporary version of my portfolio. This is currently the version I have created for the FreeCodeCamp (www.freecodecamp.com). I will soon add more projects to the page and upgrade it as well.

I have used the following for the implementation of the portfolio:
- Bootstrap 4 for the responsiveness of the page.
- SASS for the custom styling.
- Media Queries for specific screens.
- JQuery for various functionality.
